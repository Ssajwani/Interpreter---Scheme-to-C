In my fall term at Carleton College, I took the class Programming Languages with Professor Musicant, where he guided us through the steps of creating an interpreter for Scheme.
This project is mostly functioning, in the sense that it is able to handle most inputs, but it does not take into account all factors of Scheme. It is able to handle primative 
inputs, define/lambda functions, quote, and if/let in Scheme. It is able to create parse trees when given tokens (pieces of data). It also has an efficient method of freeing memory
and storing pointers.
